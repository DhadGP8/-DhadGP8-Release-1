* Dhad is an multiplatform mobile application that utilizes AR technology to help children explore Arabic alphabets, it can be used by parents and teachers to provide an efficient learning experience for their children. Our mobile application supports only the Arabic language, and it will be available in Saudi Arabia.
* We used unity to develop this project, unity uses C# programming language. the version is 2021.2.6f1.
* To run this project you have to download unity, download the unity file from the link below, upload the files to unity and click play button. in case you want to bulid it on IOS or Android device then connect the device to the laptop by usb , download the project > open it in unity > file > bulid settings > Choose the device that you connected from "run device" > bulid and Run, if you bilding for IOS device it will take you to Xcode application then it will start to bulid Dhad on your device. 'for IOS devices you need a macOS opreating system and Xcode application to build it.
* Since we couldn't upload the whole project on Github because some of the files has a size of 100MB or more which is considered to be 'too large', we tried to upload most of it in "Tags" tab under "Releases" section and we've also upload it on Google Drive untill we figure it out. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HiWsycB1MOWBrj81mq8z2yMuC_7xolEf?usp=sharing
