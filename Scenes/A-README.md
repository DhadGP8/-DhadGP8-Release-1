Here we upload our game scenes , the Scenes contain the objects of the game. They can be used to create a main menu, 
individual levels, and anything else. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene
, you will place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces(1).
